# Project Overview:
This project explores Walmart sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends across various product categories, 
and understand customer behavior. The objective is to uncover insights that can inform sales strategies and optimize performance. The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

The competition provided historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores across different regions. Each store contains multiple departments, and participants were tasked with forecasting sales for each department. The dataset includes selected holiday markdown events, 
which add complexity to the analysis as these markdowns can significantly impact sales, but the extent and affected departments are unpredictable.
